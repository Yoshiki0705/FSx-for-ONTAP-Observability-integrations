"""Dependency-free CloudWatch EMF + X-Ray instrumentation for Lambda handlers.

Why this module has no third-party dependency
---------------------------------------------
The previous version of this file imported ``aws_lambda_powertools``. That
package is installed nowhere in this repository -- there is no runtime
``requirements.txt``, no Lambda Layer that carries it, and no template that
adds a Powertools layer ARN. Meanwhile ``shared/python/build-layer.sh`` globs
``shared/python/*.py`` into the shared layer, so the module *was* shipped to
Lambda while being unimportable there. Nothing imported it, so the breakage
stayed latent.

It is also consumed across repository boundaries: the Amplify Gen2 file portal
in ``FSx-for-ONTAP-S3AccessPoints-Serverless-Patterns`` bundles its own Python dependencies
through Amplify's own packaging, so a drop-in module that needs a extra layer
attached is materially harder to adopt than one that needs none.

Hence: standard library only. CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF) needs
nothing but ``print``, and X-Ray degrades to a no-op when its SDK is absent.

What it provides
----------------
1. :class:`EmfMetrics` -- CloudWatch custom metrics via EMF, no ``PutMetricData``
   call and therefore no IAM permission and no API latency in the handler.
2. :func:`xray_subsegment` / :func:`xray_annotate` -- X-Ray custom subsegments
   and annotations, no-op when ``aws_xray_sdk`` is missing or
   ``ENABLE_XRAY=false``.
3. :func:`instrument_handler` -- one decorator that produces duration, success
   and error metrics for a Lambda handler.
4. :func:`emit_s3ap_app_signal` and the join-key helpers -- the application-layer
   half of correlating a portal request against an FSx for ONTAP audit log
   entry. See "Join-key correlation" below.

Join-key correlation
--------------------
FSx for ONTAP audit records have **no free-form field**, so a trace ID cannot be
propagated into them. The normalized audit schema
(``shared/python/ontap_audit_parser.py``) is exactly: timestamp, event_type,
source, svm, user, domain, client_ip, operation, access_protocol, path, result,
raw.

Two of those look like identity and are not, for traffic arriving over an S3
access point:

* ``user`` / ``domain`` -- ONTAP writes the literal string ``"Not Present"`` for
  the subject attributes of every operation on the S3 access path. The parser
  normalizes that to ``""``. Separately, an S3 access point attaches with a
  single ``FileSystemIdentity``, so even a populated subject would be that one
  identity rather than the end user.
* ``client_ip`` -- the address ONTAP saw. A Lambda outside the VPC reaching an
  Internet-origin access point presents its egress address, not the browser's.

What remains is the object path, the operation and the time. So correlation is a
deterministic join on ``(object key, operation, time window)``, and the end-user
attribution is supplied by the *application* side of the join -- carried here as
an X-Ray annotation and an EMF property.

Usage::

    from observability import (
        EmfMetrics, instrument_handler, emit_s3ap_app_signal,
    )

    @instrument_handler(namespace="FSxONTAPAppSignals", service="portal-list-files")
    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        emit_s3ap_app_signal(
            object_key="data/object.txt",
            operation="GET",
            principal=event["identity"]["sub"],
        )

Environment variables
---------------------
``ENABLE_XRAY``               ``false`` disables subsegments and annotations.
``EMF_NAMESPACE``             Default CloudWatch namespace.
``ENVIRONMENT``               Value of the ``Environment`` dimension.
``APP_SIGNAL_HASH_PRINCIPAL`` ``false`` records the principal verbatim instead
                              of hashing it. Default is to hash.
